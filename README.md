Due to COVID-19, people as well as suppliers have faced many difficulties. Governments have taken steps to reduce those difficulties, but still there are some issues with those solutions. 
For example in Sri Lanka, the government has introduced a mechanism to home-deliver medicines through pharmacies using WhatsApp/ Viber/ IMO. But when we try to use that service, there are issues such as

- Searching closest pharmacies is not possible.

- Hard to filter the numbers of relevant service providers due to the long list.

To fix those issues and make the delivery service easier, it is better to build a seperate app. This is the first step for that.
